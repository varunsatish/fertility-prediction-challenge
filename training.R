# This is an example script to train your model given the (cleaned) input dataset.
# 
# This script will not be run on the holdout data, 
# but the resulting model model.joblib will be applied to the holdout data.
# 
# It is important to document your training steps here, including seed, 
# number of folds, model, et cetera


train_save_model <- function(cleaned_df, outcome_df) {

  # cleaned_df (dataframe): The cleaned data from clean_df function to be used for training the model.
  # outcome_df (dataframe): The data with the outcome variable (e.g., from PreFer_train_outcome.csv or PreFer_fake_outcome.csv).

  ## This script contains a bare minimum working example
  #set.seed(1) # not useful here because logistic regression deterministic
